# birthday-app ðŸŽ‚

This is the 1st project to refresh ReactJs concepts. I am writing an article about ReactJs main concepts so I can share it with the community once it's finished.
It's a birthday app which reminds you of today's birthdays and you can clear the list once you checked. 
Topic: UseState().
